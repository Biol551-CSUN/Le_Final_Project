Chemosensation is the ability to sense chemical signal in the environment that can alter behavior and responses. For my project, I am studying salt chemosensation in a host-associated nematode species called _Pristionchus pacificus_. 

Guanylyl cyclases (*gcy*) are enzymes that can convert GTP to cGMP. These proteins are important to regulate cGMP-gated channels. The regulation of cGMP-gated cation channels helps produce calcium currents, which helps nematodes chemotaxis and detect salt concentrations in the environment.

I study the salt responses of *P.pacificus* wildtype and mutants. The mutants include: *Ppa-gcy-22,* *Ppa-che-1,* *Ppa-daf-11,* and *Ppa-tax-2.* 

Within the rMarkdown, I describe how the salt chemotaxis assays are set up with the template used. To compare the salt responses, I created chemotaxis index plots. The last plot in the rMarkdown is a comprehensive graph of all gene mutants and their salt responses.
