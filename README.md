Chemosensation is the ability to sense chemical signal in the environment that can alter behavior and responses. For my project, I am studying salt chemosensation in a host-associated nematode species called *Pristionchus pacificus*.  *P. pacifcius* is a non-parasitic nematode species that has a host assocation towards the Oriental beetle, and is attracted to a beetle sex pheromone.

Guanylyl cyclases (*gcy*) are enzymes that can convert GTP to cGMP. These proteins are important to regulate cGMP-gated channels. The regulation of cGMP-gated cation channels helps produce calcium currents, which helps nematodes chemotaxis and detect salt concentrations in the environment. It would be interesting to study if salt chemosensation and cGMP signaling is involved in host-seeking abilities for host-associated and parasitic nematodes. 

I study the salt responses of *P. pacificus* wildtype and mutants. The mutants include: *Ppa-gcy-22,* *Ppa-che-1,* *Ppa-daf-11,* and *Ppa-tax-2.* 

Within the rMarkdown, I describe how the salt chemotaxis assays are set up with the template used. To compare the salt responses, I created chemotaxis index plots. The last plot in the rMarkdown is a comprehensive graph of all gene mutants and their salt responses.

The folders for this project is organized as the following: 

-   [Data](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Le_Final_Project/tree/main/Data)
    -   [ctx_data_dictionary](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Le_Final_Project/blob/main/Data/ctx_data_dictionary.csv) is the data dictionary provided
    -   [salt_CTX_data](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Le_Final_Project/blob/main/Data/salt_CTX_data.csv) is the raw data for *Ppa-gcy-22* mutants.
    -   [salt_ctx_all_genes](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Le_Final_Project/blob/main/Data/salt_ctx_all_genes.csv) is the raw data for all *P. pacificus* wildtype and mutant strains.
